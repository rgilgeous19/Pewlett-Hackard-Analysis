# PEWLETT HACKARD ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW

The purpose of this project is to prepare for the thousands of job openings 
that will be resulted from the upcoming retirements of employees and to determine
the number of retiring employees per title, in order to identify which of those
employees are elgibile to participate in a mentorship program.

## RESULTS
  
  - First, I was able to find the total number of employees, with their titles, that are eligible to retire based on their 
    start and ending date.

  - Secondly, I was able to further sort the previous list to exclude eligible employees who had already left the company.

    [unique_titles.csv](https://github.com/rgilgeous19/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/files/8794774/unique_titles.csv)


  - Using the previous list "unique_titles", I was able to count the number of each eligible employee based on their title.
    32.5% of the employees eligible for retirement were Senior Engineers, 31.3% were Senior Staff, 15.7% were Engineers, 13.5% 
    were Staff, 4.98% were Technique Leaders, 1.95% were Assistant Engineers and 0.002 were Managers.

  - Lastly, I was able to create a table that shows which employees, based on their birthday, hire date, ending date, and title, 
    are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
